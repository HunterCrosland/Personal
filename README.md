# School projects I have completed during my time at UCLA Mathematics
  - It should be noted that many of these projects have significant dependencies, namely Simple Fast Media Library.
  - The binary files for these projects are included here, but these are unlikely to run.
  - Their inclusion in this repository is for read-only demonstration.
# Work primarily completed between August and November 2020.
